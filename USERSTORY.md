# Bus Mall User Story

## End User

The target user would be a public transportation rider, specifically bus riders. The target demographic would be working professionals over 24 years of age. 

### End User
As an end-user I am looking for something I can do passively, so clean straight-forward interface would be best. Given that I would have to give some attention to the stops on the routes the least distracting the better. Additionally, some kind of quick checkout that could be done easily would be ideal (at the very least a cart).

### UI Developer
As a developer clear requirements about the end-user so I can build an application that best serves our target users. Also, good data for so I can determine the best visualization would be ideal.

### API Developer
Since this end goal is to be a commerce app requirements for the application is paramount. Also, given the nature of the app it shouldn't be made to be overly complicated. 

### Marketing
I would like something presentable, polished, and simple so I can get buy in from our users.

### Product Owner
I want the team to build something that will get buy-in from the public. However, for my needs I will need ample resources and access to conduct requirements gathering.

## User Actions

Given there is such a broad age range a simple single page app that is clear to and easy to use would be ideal. Additionally, the time that users would have to review the site would vary so less complexity is best. Also quick scrollability through the site wold be prudent
